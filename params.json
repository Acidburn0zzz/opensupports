{"name":"OpenSupports","tagline":"Open Source Support Ticket System","body":"### Welcome to OpenSupports.\r\nOpenSupports is an open source support ticket system written in PHP. It's complety free and it is under MIT License.\r\n\r\nIf you have a website and you wish to bring help to your customers. You may think of making a contact email of a contact form. But the problem is when you need a better administration of users' consults.\r\nYou can not have an unique contact email to reply everything.\r\n\r\nThe solution is OpenSupports: OpenSupports is a support system you can easily implement into your website.\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\nOpenSupports works in a very simple way: \r\n1. You install OpenSupports into your website\r\n2. Users have questions, let's call them \"ticekts\".\r\n3. You or your staff will answer users' ticekts.\r\n4. The users send their ticekts through OpenSupports\r\n5. OpenSupports decides what path should the ticket take and then send it to the staff.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can have many categories or departments to determinate the path of the\r\nticket.\r\n\r\nAs an example, if an user has a suggestion. OpenSupport will send that ticket to\r\nsuggentions' department. If the user have an issue with your product, the ticket will be\r\nsent to issues' department.\r\nIf you bring multilanguage support, you can have several languages to make a better path.\r\nYou can also add more filters to tickets and users, like Country or Priority.\r\n\r\n### Why OpenSupports?\r\nOpenSupports has been written to be flexible, this means you can use an users system\r\n(where every user has a profile) or don't use it and use a form to send ticket without\r\nusers registration.\r\nYou can also disable registration but still using a users system. This allows you to\r\nput registration in somewhere else or use it for exclusive costumers.\r\n\r\nOne of the best features OpenSupports 3 is that it is an open source script. This means you can modify it to make it fit into your proyect.\r\nEven if you want to use for commercial applications, you can do it because it's under MIT License.\r\n\r\n### Plugins API\r\nOpenSupports 3 has a totally new plugins' API, you can make lots of modifications and\r\nplugins. You can also create new styles based in CSS.\r\n\r\nEven if you are not a developer, you can easily install plugins and styles.
