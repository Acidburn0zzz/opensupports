<a name="welcome-to-opensupports" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-opensupports"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to OpenSupports.</h3>

<p>OpenSupports is an open source support ticket system written in PHP. It's complety free and it is under MIT License.</p>

<p>If you have a website and you wish to bring help to your customers. You may think of making a contact email of a contact form. But the problem is when you need a better administration of users' consults.
You can not have an unique contact email to reply everything.</p>

<p>The solution is OpenSupports: OpenSupports is a support system you can easily implement into your website.</p>

<h3>
<a name="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works</h3>

<p>OpenSupports works in a very simple way: 
1. You install OpenSupports into your website
2. Users have questions, let's call them "ticekts".
3. You or your staff will answer users' ticekts.
4. The users send their ticekts through OpenSupports
5. OpenSupports decides what path should the ticket take and then send it to the staff.</p>

<p>For example, you can have many categories or departments to determinate the path of the
ticket.</p>

<p>As an example, if an user has a suggestion. OpenSupport will send that ticket to
suggentions' department. If the user have an issue with your product, the ticket will be
sent to issues' department.
If you bring multilanguage support, you can have several languages to make a better path.
You can also add more filters to tickets and users, like Country or Priority.</p>

<h3>
<a name="why-opensupports" class="anchor" href="#why-opensupports"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why OpenSupports?</h3>

<p>OpenSupports has been written to be flexible, this means you can use an users system
(where every user has a profile) or don't use it and use a form to send ticket without
users registration.
You can also disable registration but still using a users system. This allows you to
put registration in somewhere else or use it for exclusive costumers.</p>

<p>One of the best features OpenSupports 3 is that it is an open source script. This means you can modify it to make it fit into your proyect.
Even if you want to use for commercial applications, you can do it because it's under MIT License.</p>

<h3>
